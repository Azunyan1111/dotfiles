How to use
==========

zsh
---

Using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

[peco](https://github.com/peco/peco) and [ghq](https://github.com/motemen/ghq) are used for exploring `src` directory with `GOPATH` style.

### Tips

On zsh,

* `^S`: open any `src` directory by peco. It enables incremental search for projects you fetched.
* `sd`: search and open your documents (txt, pdf etc.) in `~/Documents` and `~/Dropbox` by peco.
* `^R`: search .zsh_history in peco.
